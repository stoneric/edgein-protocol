# EdgeIn

Edgein Protocol controls data access for value, paying users with its Solana-based Token to validate and stake data and earn. The more the users use the platform, validating and adding data and services, the more tokens they will receive from it and the community over time.  EdgeIn Protocol provides a framework for self-sovereign data services and marketplaces using decentralized technologies.  &#x20;

EdgeIn is designed to have a very long duration of increasing value for data and services, thus, a slow edge or slope of the curves underlying protocol assets; asset publishers can control their own price and market value. &#x20;

_Edge In - Don't Ape In_

The EdgeIn protocol solves the problem with Friend.Tech and unlocks unlimited potential in decentralized pricing mechanisms where value is determined by a community.  Friend.Tech epitomizes the get-rich-quick approach of Aping In with an immutable, steep valued curve:

This curve is immutable in Friend.Tech.</p></figcaption></figure>



EdgeIn Protocol can provide a steep curve but also accommodates slow growth as well as flash-fads and pop-culture meme-fueled valuations that can be changed at any time.  The EdgeIn protocol is an asset price variable based on time and mutable, thus empowering value creators to price their work accordingly.

EdgeIn assets can be valued on a timeframe of 1-1200 months and provide incentives for the creation of assets valued by a community for 100 years or more.
