# EdgeIn

Edgein Protocol controls data access for value, paying users with its Solana-based Token to validate and stake data and earn.   The EdgeIn Protocol allows users to publish, exchange, and consume data in a sustainable economic framework.  Buying a share of a dataset gives you access and a license to its use, but it could be speculative as data assets appreciate and depreciate in value. &#x20;

EdgeIn Protocol allows data publishers to establish a steady-state line of the value of any dataset as consumers pay for data services.

EdgeIn Protocol makes publishing and consuming data services accessible.  EdgeIn is designed to have a very long duration of increasing value for data and services, thus, a slow edge or slope of the curves underlying protocol assets; asset publishers can control their own price and market value.  The EdgeIn Protocol provides data access services to datasets and a DeFi mechanism for dynamic pricing.

EdgeIn Protocol draws inspiration from multiple projects on data access and the SoFi application Friend.Tech, providing an onramp for aligning social interactions around financial activities and data services.  EdgeIn Protocol is an evolutionary approach to social pricing and decentralized data services to create a sustainable application framework for data marketplaces.



_Edge In - Don't Ape In_

The EdgeIn protocol solves the problem with Friend.Tech and unlocks unlimited potential in decentralized pricing mechanisms where a community determines value.  Friend.Tech epitomizes the get-rich-quick approach of Aping In with an immutable, steep valued curve:

This curve is immutable in Friend.Tech.</p></figcaption></figure>



EdgeIn Protocol can provide a steep curve but also accommodates slow growth, flash-fads, and pop-culture meme-fueled valuations that can be changed over time.  The EdgeIn protocol is an asset price variable based on time and mutable, thus empowering value creators to price their work accordingly.

EdgeIn assets can be valued within 1-1200 months and provide incentives for creating assets valued by a community for 100 years or more.
