# EdgeIn

Edgein Protocol controls data access for value, paying users with its Solana-based Token to validate and stake data and earn. The more the users use the platform, validating and adding data and services, the more tokens they will receive from it and the community over time.  EdgeIn Protocol provides a framework for self-sovereign data services and marketplaces using decentralized technologies. &#x20;

EdgeIn is designed to have a very long duration of increasing value for data and services, thus, a slow edge or slope of the curves underlying protocol assets.  However, any asset publisher can control their own price and market value.  Edging-in contrasts Aping in, where accrued value is recognized by the community over time versus the first thousand people to discover something early, such as the Beatle's single, Hey Jude, which should not reward the first thousand listeners over the next billion.
