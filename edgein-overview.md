# EdgeIn Overview

The EdgeIn Protocol is an on-ramp for data services using crypto ecosystems based on data NFTs and datatokens in a governance framework. \
\
A data NFT is a non-fungible token representing any actual data set of a data service; a data token is a fungible token to access and pay for the service or, inversely, to collect payment for the data service. Shares of data services are priced on a quadratic curve and are rebasable.  EdgeIn makes it easy to publish data services, mint data NFTs and datatokens, consume data services, and speculate on data assets in a flexible, easy-to-use social data marketplace.  &#x20;

A vote-escrowed EdgeIn token, or veEdgeIn, is the social currency of the EdgeIn Protocol and is derived from locked EdgeIn, granting governance, or social power on the network on a multiple by the time locked.  veEdgeIn can be used for curation, rewards, and a variety of other utility functions. EdgeIn Protocol assets that are bonded and related to profiles are the true objects of the social economy and not the profiles themselves and are composible, allowing greater flexibility with a focus on data assets and not necessarily the profiles themselves.  EdgeIn Protocol does not establish a cult of personality, rather, it creates a cult of asset value through a combination of staking identity profiles and their related assets and locking EdgeIn -- a user-centric data economy.
