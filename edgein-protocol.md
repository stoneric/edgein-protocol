# EdgeIn Protocol

The EdgeIn Protocol is an on-ramp for data services using crypto ecosystems based on data NFTs and datatokens in a governance framework. \
\
A data NFT is a non-fungible token representing any actual data set of a data service; a data token is a fungible token to access and pay for the service or, inversely, to collect payment for the data service. Shares of data services are priced on a quadratic curve and are rebasable.  EdgeIn makes it easy to publish data services, mint data NFTs and datatokens, consume data services, and speculate on data assets in a flexible, easy-to-use social data marketplace.  &#x20;

A vote-escrowed EdgeIn token, or veEdgeIn, is the social currency of the EdgeIn Protocol and is derived from locked EdgeIn, granting governance, or social power on the network on a multiple by the time locked.  veEdgeIn can be used for curation, rewards, and a variety of other utility functions. Through a combination of staking identity profiles and their related assets and locking EdgeIn, a user-centric data economy can be created that is based on the veEdgeIn social currency.
