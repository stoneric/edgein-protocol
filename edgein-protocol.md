# EdgeIn Protocol

The EdgeIn protocol is an on-ramp for data services using crypto ecosystems based on data NFTs and datatokens in a governance framework. \
\
A data NFT is a non-fungible token representing any actual data set of a data service; a data token is a fungible token to access and pay for the service or, inversely, to collect payment for the data service. Shares of data services are priced on a quadratic curve and are rebasable/mutable.  EdgeIn smart contracts and programs make it easy to publish data services, mint data NFTs and datatokens, and consume data services in a flexible, easy-to-use decentralized system.  &#x20;

EdgeIn smart contracts are programs that run on the Solana blockchain, the EdgeIn token is the datatoken, and veEdgeIn (vote-escrowed EdgeIn) is a governance token. The Solana blockchain was selected due to its high transaction processing speed, cost, and developer tooling.

For example, perhaps you're interested in partnering with another company to gain a competitive edge through joint efforts in developing AI prediction models. However, you may not be comfortable entrusting the other company with your sensitive data. In such a scenario, you can leverage EdgeIn to conduct data analysis on datasets from both companies without disclosing the actual data itself.

As a company, you frequently possess a substantial amount of data and may seek to enlist the services of another company for data analysis, prediction model development, and problem-solving. However, the challenge lies in the sensitivity of your data and the reluctance to expose it to potential issues when sharing it with an analysis company. In such circumstances, you can utilize EdgeIn to offer your data. This approach allows data scientists to train models without direct access to or the ability to copy your data. As a result, you maintain complete control over your data throughout the process.
