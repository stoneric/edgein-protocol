# EdgeIn Protocol

The EdgeIn protocol is an on-ramp for data services using crypto ecosystems based on data NFTs and datatokens in a governance framework. \
\
A data NFT is a non-fungible token representing any actual data set of a data service; a data token is a fungible token to access and pay for the service or, inversely, to collect payment for the data service. Shares of data services are priced on a quadratic curve and are rebasable/mutable.  EdgeIn smart contracts and programs make it easy to publish data services, mint data NFTs and datatokens, and consume data services in a flexible, easy-to-use decentralized system.  &#x20;

EdgeIn smart contracts are programs that run on the Solana blockchain, the EdgeIn token is the datatoken, and veEdgeIn (vote-escrowed EdgeIn) is a governance token. The Solana blockchain was selected due to its high transaction processing speed, cost, and developer tooling.
